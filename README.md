# TypeScript Boilerplate

This repository serves as a starting point for TypeScript projects, providing a
minimalistic structure to kickstart your development journey.

Install nodejs and pnpm tools specified in [`.tool-versions`](./.tool-versions) using the [asdf
version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

```sh
❯ asdf install
```

Install project dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```sh
❯ pnpm install
```

Execute the program with the `start` command.

```sh
❯ pnpm start
```

Check out the [`package.json`](./package.json) for a list of available commands.
